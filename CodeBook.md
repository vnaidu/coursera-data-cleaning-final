## Raw Data: Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset

### Source
UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository

### Abstract
"Human Activity Recognition database built from the recordings of 30 subjects performing activities of daily living (ADL) while carrying a waist-mounted smartphone with embedded inertial sensors."

### Experiment Information
"The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data."

"The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain."

### Attribute Information
For each record in the dataset, the following attributes are provided:
- Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration.
- Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope.
- A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables.
- The activity performed while the corresponding measurements
 were taken. Possible levels include:
- An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.

***
## ETL Steps:
1. Merge the training and the test sets to create one dataset.
2. Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the dataset
4. Appropriately label the dataset with descriptive variable names.

## Tidy Dataset Features:
### Identifiers
- `subject` - ID assigned to each test subject
- `activity` - activity performed while the corresponding measurements were taken. Possible levels include:
  - 1 = `WALKING`
  - 2 = `WALKING_UPSTAIRS`
  - 3 = `WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS`
  - 4 = `SITTING`
  - 5 = `STANDING`
  - 6 = `LAYING`

### Measurements
Mean and standard deviation measurement variables extracted from raw datasets in step 2.
